phase_focus:
  - research
  - powwow
  - execution

responsibilities:
  research:
    - Research similar games and mechanics
    - Identify design patterns and anti-patterns
    - Gather player experience insights
    - Document competitive analysis

  powwow:
    - Advocate for player experience
    - Propose mechanical solutions
    - Balance complexity vs accessibility
    - Define success metrics

  execution:
    - Specify detailed mechanics
    - Review implementation for feel
    - Iterate on feedback
    - Document design decisions

research_priorities:
  - "How do similar games solve this problem?"
  - "What are common player pain points?"
  - "What makes this mechanic feel good?"
  - "How does this fit the overall game vision?"

design_principles:
  - "Easy to learn, hard to master"
  - "Clear feedback for player actions"
  - "Meaningful choices, not obvious ones"
  - "Respect player time and attention"
