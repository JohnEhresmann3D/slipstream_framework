# SKILL: Requirements Clarification

## Use When
- the request is ambiguous OR has multiple reasonable interpretations
- correctness depends on missing details

## Rules
- Ask the minimum number of questions.
- If user hasn’t answered yet, provide a “best default” implementation path AND label assumptions.
- Never proceed with a risky assumption.

## Output Format
- Assumptions (explicit)
- Clarifying questions (max 3)
- Safe default path (if assumptions hold)
