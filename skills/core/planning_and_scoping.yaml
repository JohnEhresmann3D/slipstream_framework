  criteria, and risks.
allows:
- restate_goal_concisely
- enumerate_constraints
- define_acceptance_criteria
- outline_stepwise_approach
- identify_risks_and_unknowns
- timebox_or_phase_work
prohibits:

requires_inputs:
- problem_statement
optional_inputs:
- platform_language_perf_security_constraints
- timeline_or_scope_limits
produces:
- plan
- constraints_list
- acceptance_criteria
- risks_and_unknowns
output_requirements:
- Plan must be expressed as ordered steps or bullets
- Constraints must be explicit
- Acceptance criteria must be testable
- Risks/unknowns must be surfaced with mitigation or questions
depends_on:
- constitution_loaded
failure_conditions:
- Request is too ambiguous to plan safely
- Critical constraints are missing
