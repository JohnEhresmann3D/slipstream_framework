# SKILL: Reliability & Failure Modes

## Use When
- background jobs, retries, queues
- external services / flaky networks
- stateful systems

## Checklist
- What fails? (network, disk, auth, rate limits)
- Timeouts, retries, backoff, idempotency
- Observability: logs/metrics/traces
- Graceful degradation
- Data integrity: transactions, invariants

## Output Format
- Failure modes
- Handling strategy
- Monitoring plan
